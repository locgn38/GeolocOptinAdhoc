<h2>Instructions, Tips and Tricks</h2>

<p>Here is a hodgepodge of instructions, tips, and tricks for working with 
GIS REST web services.</p>

<h3>Service Output</h3>
<p>Service output is standardized for all REST web services with the exception 
of those originating from other providers, such as the Google Geocode. Format for 
all REST services comes in two or three flavors set by the format paramater: XML, KML, or JSON.  
XML is a standard data exchange format and is most appropriate for use in server 
or application side coding, where XML parsers frequently exist. JSON is most 
appropriate for consumption by Javascript. Each return is essentially a XML, KML or
JSON representation of a record set.</p>

<p>XML output looks like this:</p>
	<pre>
	&lt;rows total-rows="2"&gt;
	&lt;row&gt;
	&lt;column name="column_1"&gt;Column Value&lt;/column&gt;
	&lt;column name="column_2"&gt;Column Value&lt;/column&gt;
	&lt;/row&gt;
	&lt;row&gt;
	&lt;column name="column_1"&gt;Column Value&lt;/column&gt;
	&lt;column name="column_2"&gt;Column Value&lt;/column&gt;
	&lt;/row&gt;
	&lt;/rows&gt;
	</pre>

<p>The XML container tag is "rows". The "rows" tag contains child "row" tags, one 
for each record returned. Note the "rows" tag has a "total-rows" property, which 
indicates the number of rows returned by the query. Each "row" tag has any number
of child "column" tags. The "column" tag represents a field or column in the return
record set, with the "name" property being the name of the field or column. The value 
of the "column" tag is the value of that column for that record.</p>

<p>If your query returns no records, the XML response is this:</p>
	<pre>
	&lt;rows total-rows="0"/&gt;
	</pre>

<p>JSON output looks like this:</p>
	<pre>
	{"total_rows":"1","rows":[
	{"row":{"column_1":"column value", "column_2":"column value"}},
	{"row":{"column_1":"column value", "column_2":"column value"}}
	]}
	</pre>
	
<p>Essentially, there's a "total_rows" value and then a parent "rows" element 
containing a series of "row" elements, one for 
each record returned. Each "row" element contains a comma delimited column:value pairs. 
This format is easily digested by a Javascript eval().</p>

<p>If your query returns no records, the JSON response is this:</p>
	<pre>
	{"total_rows":"0","rows":"row"}
	</pre>
	
<p>KML output looks like this:</p>
	<pre>
    &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;
    &lt;kml xmlns="http://www.opengis.net/kml/2.2"&gt;
      &lt;Document&gt;
        &lt;Placemark&gt;
          &lt;name&gt;Monroe Middle School&lt;/name&gt;
          &lt;Point&gt;
            &lt;coordinates&gt;-80.538976082676783,34.973003351596738&lt;/coordinates&gt;
          &lt;/Point&gt;
          &lt;ExtendedData&gt;
            &lt;Data name="name"&gt;
              &lt;value&gt;Monroe Middle School&lt;/value&gt;
            &lt;/Data&gt;
          &lt;/ExtendedData&gt;
        &lt;/Placemark&gt;
      &lt;/Document&gt;
    &lt;/kml&gt;
	</pre>

	<p>If your query returns no records, the KML response is this:</p>
	<pre>
    &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;
    &lt;kml xmlns="http://www.opengis.net/kml/2.2"&gt;
      &lt;Document /&gt;
    &lt;/kml&gt;
	</pre>
	
	<p>There are 2 things to keep in mind when requesting data in KML format</p>
	<ol>
		<li>A field with valid KML named "kml" is required for output. This is as simple as adding "st_askml(the_geom)+as+kml" in your "fields" URL parameter.</li>
		<li>The first field returned in your record set will show up in the "name" tag of your KML</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>KML output is only available for the following services:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Attribute Query</li>
		<li>Buffer Feature</li>
		<li>Buffer Point</li>
		<li>Feature Overlay</li>
		<li>Point Overlay</li>
	</ul>

<p>If your query creates an error, you will recieve an XML error message that looks 
like this:</p>
	<pre>
	&lt;error_handler&gt;
  	&lt;error&gt;
	&lt;error_message&gt;Error message.&lt;/error_message&gt;
  	&lt;/error&gt;
	&lt;/error_handler&gt;
	</pre>

<p>As the REST return is text, you can perform a simple text string search for 
"&lt;error_handler&gt;" in the result to check and see if you've got problems. The 
information is purposely limited to keep from passing sensitive applicaiton and 
database information to users. If you need to do some serious debugging, let us know 
and we can help.</p> 

<h3>Customizing Fields and Parameters</h3>
<p>Many of our GEO REST services off you the ability to set custom parameters and fields 
for your query. We do this because (a) we don't know what you want, and (b) we're not going
to write web services to handle every request. By keeping the services generic we maximize 
code reuse and interoperability.</p>

<p>The parameters argument lets you set additional parameters for the query as you would 
in a SQL where request. For example, suppose you are doing a point buffer and you want 
to buffer your point by 500 feet and return the voting precincts in that buffer. But suppose 
you also want to only return voting precincts in the buffer where the precinct (precno) 
number is greater than 100. Simply add that as a parameter (URL encoding left off here 
for readability):</p>
	<pre>
	parameters = precno &gt; 100
	</pre>

<p>If you don't need additional parameters, simply leave the parameters argument empty.</p>

<p>The fields argument allows you to specify what fields you would like returned. You 
can get a list of fields for a geotable with the List Fields GEO service.</p>

<p>You can also use the fields parameter to change the field name used in your return. 
For example (URL encoding left off here for readability):</p>
	<pre>
	fields = precno as precinct_number, cc as county_commissioner_district
	</pre>

<p>One of the really cool things you can do with the fields argument is to return geometry. 
You can return geometry as KML, GML, WKT, or SVG. Here are some exampes: </p>

	<pre>
	KML
	fields = askml(the_geom) as the_geom
	
	GML
	fields = asgml(the_geom) as the_geom
	
	WKT
	fields = asewkt(the_geom) as the_geom
	
	SVG
	assvg(the_geom) as the_geom</pre>


<p>There are a number of things to note here. First the_geom is the name of the geometry 
column in all of our geotables, hence the (the_geom) argument. The second thing to note is 
the return value is in the projection of the geotable (which you can find out with the List 
Layers web service). If you want it in a different projection, you would need to use the 
transform option, as seen here: </p>

	<pre>
	KML projected to SRID 4326
	fields = askml(transform(the_geom, 4326)) as the_geom</pre>

<p>4326 is the SRID we want the data returned in. So, in this example, we want the geometry 
converted to 4326 (decimal degrees) and then returned as KML.</p>

<h3>Consuming with PHP</h3>
<p>First let's take a look at consuming a web service with PHP. Here's an example of 
a feature overlay:</p>
	<pre>
	# Set the web service parameters.
	$params = array( 
	'fields'  =&gt; 't.precno, t.cc',
	'from_geotable'  =&gt; 'tax_parcels',
	'to_geotable'  =&gt; 'voting_precincts',
	'parameters'  =&gt; "f.pid = '11111111'",
	'format' =&gt; 'xml'
	);
	
	# Set the base URL of the web service.
	$base = 'http://theurl/ws_geo_featureoverlay.php';
	
	# URL encode the parameters.
	$query_string = "";
	foreach ($params as $key =&gt; $value) { 
    	$query_string .= "$key=" . urlencode($value) . "&amp;";
	}
	$url = "$base?$query_string";
	
	# Get the return results.
	$result = file_get_contents($url);</pre>
	
<p>That code gets the return results, in this case in XML, and assigns them to the 
$results variable. Note that the file_get_contents is only available in PHP 5.x or 
higher. PHP 4 users will have to use the CURL library.</p>

<p>Now that we've received web service output, let's process it.</p>
	<pre>
	# Check for error
	if (stripos($result, "error_handler") != false) {
		echo "Cap'n, we have an error!";
	}
	# Otherwise process result
	else {
		$xml = new SimpleXMLElement($result);
		# Check number of returned records
		if ($xml-&gt;rows['total-rows'] = 0) {
			echo "No records found!";
		}
		else {
			echo "Total Rows: " . $xml['total-rows'] . "&lt;br /&gt;";
			foreach ($xml-&gt;row as $row) {
				echo "Row &lt;br /&gt;";
				foreach ($row-&gt;column as $column) {
					echo $column['name'] . ": ";
					echo $column . "&lt;br /&gt;";
				}
			}
		}
	}</pre>

<p>First, we checked for an error message. If no message was found, we load the return
result into a SimpleXMLElement. We then check to see if any records were returned. If 
they were, we loop through each row and then each column in each row and echo the result. 
The result looks like this:</p>

	<pre>
	Total Rows: 1
	Row
	precno: 201
	cc: 3</pre>

<h3>Consuming with .NET</h3>
<p>With .NET, connecting to a REST service is about the same amount of work as connecting 
to a SOAP service. Instead of creating a web proxy, we'll just use a function to build 
a url to the web service.</p>

	<pre>
 	Private Function wsListLayers(ByVal geotable As String, ByVal format As String) As String
        Dim strURL As String = "http://theurl/ws_geo_listfields.php"

        strURL &amp;= "?geotable=" &amp; Server.UrlEncode(geotable)
        strURL &amp;= "&amp;format=" &amp; Server.UrlEncode(format)

        Return strURL
    End Function</pre>
	
<p>Here are callout the List Fields web service to get a list of a geotable. Now we can 
call the function and process the results.</p>

	<pre>
	Dim strURL As String
    Dim xmlDoc As New System.Xml.XmlDocument()
    Dim mylist As System.Xml.XmlNodeList
    Dim row As System.Xml.XmlNode
    Dim node As System.Xml.XmlNode
    Dim i As Integer


    'Load the service as a XML document
    strURL = wsListLayers("polling_locations", "xml")
    xmlDoc.Load(strURL)

    'Process the return
    If xmlDoc.GetElementsByTagName("error_handler").Count &gt; 0 Then
        Response.Write("Dude we bombed.")
    ElseIf xmlDoc.GetElementsByTagName("row").Count = 0 Then
        Response.Write("Dude we gots no records.")
    Else
        mylist = xmlDoc.GetElementsByTagName("row")
        For Each row In mylist
            Response.Write("Row " &amp; i &amp; "&lt;br /&gt;")
            For Each node In row
                Response.Write(node.Attributes.Item(0).Value &amp; ": " &amp; node.InnerText &amp; "&lt;br /&gt;")
            Next
            i = i + 1
        Next
    End If</pre>

<p>The output will look like this: </p>
	<pre>
	Row 0
	field_name: gid
	field_type: int4
	Row 1
	field_name: objectid
	field_type: int4
	Row 2
	field_name: precno
	field_type: int4
	Row 3
	field_name: name
	field_type: varchar
	Row 4
	....</pre>
	

<h3>Consuming with JavaScript</h3>
<p>JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation, is a lightweight, human-readable interchange 
format. JSON has a number of advantages over XML when consumed with JavaScript:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>It's extremely easy to create and use.</li>
		<li>It's fast. Its smaller size makes for quicker transport and process.</li>
		<li>It's a native JavaScript data format, making processing with JavaScript
			extremely easy.</li> 
	</ul>

<p>While you can process XML output with JavaScript via the DOM, JSON processing with 
JavaScript is much easier. Let's look at a consuming a web service. Note that we're 
taking advantage of the excellent jQuery JavaScript library.</p>

	<pre>
	&lt;script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
	&lt;script&gt;
	
	$(document).ready(function(){
    	$.getJSON("http://theurl/ws_geo_listfields.php?geotable=voting_precincts&amp;format=json", 
    	function(data){
  		$.each(data.rows, function(i, item){
    	$('#results').append(item.row.field_name + ': ' + item.row.field_type + '&lt;br /&gt;');
  			});
		});
  	});
  	&lt;/script&gt;
  	&lt;div id="results"&gt;Fields:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</pre>

<p>Here's we're calling the List Fields GEO web service when the document is ready to 
process an AJAX request. If the data is successfully loaded, for each row in rows it 
appends the field name and type to a DIV tag with an ID of 'results'.</p>

<p>The output will look like this:</p>
	<pre>
	Fields:
	gid: int4
	objectid: int4
	precno: int4
	cc: int4
	school: int4
	jud: varchar
	zone: int4
	area: numeric
	len: numeric
	the_geom: geometry</pre>

<p>You can also call JSON with an optional callback parameter to be returned JSONP. This lets
you get around the cross site scripting security in most browsers. For example, if you put this 
argument at the end of your REST URL:</p>

<pre>&callback=myfunction</pre>

<p>Then the return will look like this:</p>

<pre>
	myfunction({"total_rows":"1","rows":[
	{"row":{"column_1":"column value", "column_2":"column value"}},
	{"row":{"column_1":"column value", "column_2":"column value"}}
	]})
	</pre>
	
<p>Then all you'll need to do is create a myfunction function on your page to handle the return:</p>

<pre>function myfunction(data) {....}</pre>
	
<p>For more information on JSON and using it with other languages, check out 
<a href="http://www.json.org/" target="_blank">json.org</a>.</p>


<h3>Consuming with VB6</h3>
<p>The easiest way to consume REST services from VB6 is to use the Internet Transfer Control 
(IE Control).</p>
<pre>
'Assuming you have built your REST URL and called it restURL and your IE control is called iNet
Dim getXMLDoc as String

' cancel any pending operation and set protocol to HTTP
iNet.Cancel
iNet.Protocol = icHTTP
' get the XML
getXMLDoc = iNet.OpenURL(restURL)
</pre>
<p>getXMLDoc now has the service XML output. To parse the XML, they just need to use the XML 
DOM for working with XML in VB (Project > References, check "Microsoft XML, v4.0").</p>


<h3>General Tips</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The URL to the web serice is in the Service URL link at the top of each 
		web service's documentation.</li>
	<li>Most Mecklenburg County GIS data is in SRID 2264, or NC State Plane NAD83 
		feet. The most popular thing to convert it to would be 4326, decimal degrees.</li>
	<li>If you use Firefox and Firebug for AJAX debugging, this bit of code for jQuery 
		will write AJAX error messages to the console: $(document).ajaxError(function(){
    if (window.console && window.console.error) { console.error(arguments); } });</li>
</ul>
